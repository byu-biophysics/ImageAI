## TODO:
- FSL Groups (Braxton is an group manager so he can add as well as Gus)
- Quartz(along with X11 forwarding: denoted by -X option for ssh) for using GUI on Super Computer
- Access super computer via vscode (consider .ssh/config option for setting up alias and multiplexing i.e. ssh sc)
# ImageAI Walkthru
1. Setup an account on and download Zulip. We will use this to communicate within our group.
    * https://zulip.com
    * Ask any group member to send you an invitation to our Zulip organization
2.  Get an account on the supercomputer
    * Go to https://rc.byu.edu
    * Click on "Request an account" in the top right corner
    * Follow the prompts to send your request, you will need to
      login with your byu email and provide some information about our project
    * 
          - Professor Hart's id is glh43. When asked for info about your project,
            just say that you are working on an imageAI biophysics project sorting
            pictures of the flagellar motor.You will be doing machine learning and
            will be using PyTorch. One job at a time requesting up to 16GB on a GPU.
    * After about a day you should receive an email on your byu email saying that your request has been approved or denied.
      * If it is denied: ->let us know in the ImageAI channel on Zulip. Give the reasoning why.
      * If it is approved: ->You are ready to proceed and access the Supercomputer!
    * Return to https://rc.byu.edu and login. Under 'Documentation' click 'Logging in'
    * Download Google Authenticator and set it up using the 'Two factor Authentication' link at the bottom of the page
    * If using Mac (GOOD JOB!) open terminal and type  "ssh *username*@ssh.rc.byu.edu" replacing *username* with yours
    * You will then be prompted to enter your password you made on the rc.byu website followed by your 6-digit authentication code (google authenticator)
    * You will not immediately have access to the group's shared files and directories.
    * Begin following the tutorials under the documentation section of the rc website. (Most of the YT vids are out of date but there are a few seminars from 2020 you can look at. Mainly just focus on '**Linux tutorial**'. This will teach you how to navigate the supercomputer.)
    * Once you feel comfortable with the LinuxOS let us know and we will give you access to our shared group directory.

3.  Get Julia installed
    * Go to https://julialang.org/downloads/
    * If using Mac, be sure to check which processor/chip your computer has. (APPLE LOGO, About this Mac)
        * If it says "Chip" anywhere, be sure to download the Apple Silicon .dmg file.
        * If it says "Processor" anwhere, be sure to download the Intel .dmg .
    * Follow the instructions to get Julia up and running!
4.  Install VScode
    * Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    * Be sure to follow the same rules about the chip/processor
    * Install the Julia extension
      * Open VScode and press command[⌘], shift[⇧], [X]
      * Search Julia and install the 'Julia Language Support' extension
    * You are now ready to use Julia in VScode!
5.   Install IMOD
    * Go to https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/download.html
    * Select Linux, Mac, or Windows and then install the IMOD package using the one-click installer link or the command-line link
    * Once installed, use the command imodinfo to verify that you have downloaded it correctly      

5.  Do Chapters 1, 2, and 9 of Giordano and pass it off [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwuWKhjxmHehSVlJTS4vgwJxQZZZxg5z0vF_GyNLXE0/edit?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRZ3O7edJSBFz9f5hYGVnzf6_JLeRBmc?usp=sharing)

## Getting started with MNIST
Congratulations! You have finished the warmup and setup and are now ready to get started workin with AI. We will start with the MNIST data set.
1. Setting up PyTorch
   * Tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v43SlgBcZ5Y&t=773s
   * In your terminal write: `conda create --name pytorch2`
   * Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and install PyTorch according to your OS, copy and paste the command it gives you
   * Back in your terminal write `conda activate torch`
   *

# ImageAI (Old)
This repo serves as a guide for the BYU Image Segmentation group. Below, papers and videos are listed to introduce the topic of Tomogram AI.

## Papers
[Isonet](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.17.452128v1.full) is a deep learning-based software package that iteratively reconstructs the missing-wedge information and increases signal-to-noise ratio, using the knowledge learned from raw tomograms. The software is stored [here](https://github.com/IsoNet-cryoET/IsoNet) on GitHub.

[This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096921261930005X?via%3Dihub) discusses a framework for discovoring new structures in tomograms.

## Books
[Here](https://www.cellstructureatlas.org/) is an online textbook by Grant Jenson on microbial cells guided by cutting-edge 3D electron microscopy.

## Examples
There is not much currently in this [directory](https://github.com/byu-biophysics/ImageSegmentation/tree/main/examples), however it serves as a location for various "play" scripts for learning fundametals of Tomogram AI. 

## Holiday To Dos
* Read Min Xu paper, discuss on zulip (Gus, Braxton, ...)
* Make a "tree" of tomogram AI literature (Gus, Braxton)
* Play with Braxtons CNN (all)
* Work on tutorial for NN and MLP (Gus)
* Update github repo (Braxton)
* Update anki with new stuff (Gus)
